                Houston-based private space company Axiom has forged a
                partnership with
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX">SpaceX</a> to fly
                paying tourists to the ISS as soon as the second half of 2021.
                Under the terms of their deal, SpaceX will use the
                <span style="color: blue">Crew Dragon</span> capsule to ferry
                three tourists and an Axiom staff member, who'll make sure they
                don't interfere with the NASA crew members doing their job, to
                the orbiting lab. It's worth noting that Axiom was the company
                NASA chose to build the space station's first commercial
                destination module.
